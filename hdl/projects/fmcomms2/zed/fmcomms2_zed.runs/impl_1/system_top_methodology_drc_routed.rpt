2. REPORT DETAILS

TIMING-54#1 Critical Warning
Scoped false path, clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between clocks  
A scoped Max Delay Datapath Only timing constraint is set between clocks clk_div_sel_0_s and clk_fpga_0 (see constraint position 77 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#2 Critical Warning
Scoped false path, clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between clocks  
A scoped Max Delay Datapath Only timing constraint is set between clocks clk_div_sel_0_s and clk_fpga_0 (see constraint position 84 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is not recommended to define such scoped constraints between clocks as the constraint impacts timing paths outside of the scope.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-54#3 Critical Warning
Scoped false path, clock group or max delay datapath only constraint between clocks  
A scoped Max Delay Datapath Only timing constraint is set between clocks clk_div_sel_1_s and clk_fpga_0 (see constraint position 77 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE).

CKBF-1#1 Warning
connects_I_driver_BUFR  
The BUFGCTRL cell i_system_wrapper/system_i/util_ad9361_divclk/inst/i_div_clk_gbuf I0 pin is driven by a BUFR cell i_system_wrapper/system_i/util_ad9361_divclk/inst/clk_divide_sel_0. For 7-Series devices, this is not a recommended clock topology. Please analyze your clock network and remove the BUFR to BUFGCTRL cascade.
Related violations: <none>

CKBF-1#2 Warning
connects_I_driver_BUFR  
The BUFGCTRL cell i_system_wrapper/system_i/util_ad9361_divclk/inst/i_div_clk_gbuf I1 pin is driven by a BUFR cell i_system_wrapper/system_i/util_ad9361_divclk/inst/clk_divide_sel_1. For 7-Series devices, this is not a recommended clock topology. Please analyze your clock network and remove the BUFR to BUFGCTRL cascade.

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -quiet -hier *reset_sync_in_reg*/PRE -filter {NAME =~ *i_reset_manager*}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '109' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE).
